	/**
	 * @brief A chip area for grouping chip elements together (entity in vhdl)
	 * @details The actual area is (usually) created by instantiating a GroupScope variable via Area::enter().
	 * All logic created while that GroupScope variable exists will be placed inside the area.
	 * Areas can be nested.
	 *
	 * Essentially, there are two ways of using areas: Either directly:
	 * @code
	 *	{ // scoping bracket
	 *	Area newArea("ip_core", true);
	 *
	 *	// Build logic that is to be placed in the "ip_core" area
	 *
	 *	} // closing scoping bracket
	 * @endcode
	 * Or by entering the scope manually:
	 * @code
	 *  Area newArea("ip_core", false);
	 *	{ // scoping bracket
	 *	  auto scp = newArea.enter();
	 *
	 *	  // Build logic that is to be placed in the "ip_core" area
	 *
	 *	} // closing scoping bracket
	 *
	 *  // ...
	 *
	 *	{ // scoping bracket
	 *	  auto scp = newArea.enter();
	 *
	 *	  // Build more logic that is to be placed in the "ip_core" area
	 *
	 *	} // closing scoping bracket
	 * @endcode
